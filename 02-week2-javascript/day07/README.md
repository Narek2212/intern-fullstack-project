# Day 07 — Arrays + objects
## Goal
Use `map/filter/reduce` and object updates to transform data.

## Learn (30–60 min)
- Use `map` to transform arrays.
- Use `filter` to keep items.
- Build a count object from an array.

## Resources

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
```

## Example
```js
const nums = [1,2,3];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n*2); // [2,4,6]
```

## Tasks (60–120 min)
- Complete `tasks.js` functions.
- Verify output in Console.

## Deliverables
- Updated `tasks.js`

## Self-check
- Functions return correct values for given data.
- You can explain why `map` returns a new array.

## Common mistakes
- Mutating the original array accidentally.
- Using `forEach` when you need `map`/`filter` output.

## Stretch goals
- Solve each task twice: loop version and array-method version.

## PR notes
- Include screenshots (mobile + desktop) when there is UI.
- Write 3–6 sentences: what you learned + what was hard.
