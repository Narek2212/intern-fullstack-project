# Day 06 — JavaScript basics (values, functions)
## Goal
Write simple functions and verify them with tiny tests.

## Learn (30–60 min)
- Use `const`/`let` properly.
- Write functions that return values.
- Use `console.log` to test.

## Resources

```

## Example
```js
function sum(a,b){ return a + b; }
console.log(sum(2,3)); // 5
```

## Tasks (60–120 min)
- Open `tasks.js` and implement the TODOs.
- Run by opening `index.html` and checking Console output.

## Deliverables
- Updated `tasks.js` with working functions

## Self-check
- All console “expected … ->” lines match expected values.
- No syntax errors in Console.

## Common mistakes
- Forgetting `return`.
- Accidentally using string concatenation instead of numbers.

## Stretch goals
- Add 2 more tests per function.

## PR notes
- Include screenshots (mobile + desktop) when there is UI.
- Write 3–6 sentences: what you learned + what was hard.
