# Day 00 — Setup
## Goal
Install tools and prove everything works so future days are smooth.

## Learn (30–60 min)
- Install Node.js LTS, Git, VS Code, Chrome/Edge.
- Learn how to open a folder in VS Code and use a terminal.
- Create a GitHub repo from this template (or fork it).

## Resources
```text
https://nodejs.org/en/download
https://git-scm.com/downloads
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/
```

## Tasks (60–120 min)
- Install Node.js (LTS).
- Install Git.
- Install VS Code.
- Create a GitHub repo from this template (or fork it).
- Create branch `day00-setup`.
- Create `00-setup/verification.txt` and paste outputs of: `node -v`, `npm -v`, `git --version`.
- Open this repo in VS Code and commit the verification file.

## Deliverables
- `00-setup/verification.txt` committed
- PR opened for Day 00

## Self-check
- `node -v` prints a version
- `git --version` prints a version
- You can push a branch to GitHub

## Common mistakes
- Node installed but terminal still shows ‘command not found’ (restart terminal / check PATH).
- Committing on main instead of a branch.

## Stretch goals
- Install the React Developer Tools browser extension (for later).

## PR notes
- Include screenshots (mobile + desktop) when there is UI.
- Write 3–6 sentences: what you learned + what was hard.
