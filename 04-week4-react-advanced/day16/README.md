```

## Example
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

## Tasks (60–120 min)
- Add routes: Home, Projects, Contact.
- Add a shared layout with navbar.
- Add a 404 page.

## Deliverables
- Working navigation and routes

## Self-check
- No full page reload on nav
- 404 works
- URLs change correctly

## Common mistakes
- Forgetting to wrap app in Router
- Using `<a>` instead of `<Link>` for internal nav

## Stretch goals
- Add active link styling.

## PR notes
- Include screenshots (mobile + desktop) when there is UI.
- Write 3–6 sentences: what you learned + what was hard.
